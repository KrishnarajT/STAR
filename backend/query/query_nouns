Ceramics => "answers": [
    "This Standard primarily addresses structural and non-structural design and verification \nrequirements for glass and windows in human-rated space vehicles, space suits, and habitats. \nThe same requirements apply to ceramics, which have similar characteristics.  The sole use of \nthe word \u201cglass\u201d does not preclude requirement applicability to ceramics. \n\n4.1 \n\nIntroduction\nGlass:  A large class of materials with highly variable mechanical and optical \nproperties. Glass solidifies from the molten state without crystallization and is typically made \nby fusing silicates with boric oxide, aluminum oxide, or phosphorus pentoxide.  Glass is \ngenerally hard, brittle, and transparent or translucent.  Glass is an amorphous  \nmaterial that is isotropic and elastic. \n\nGlass Ceramics:  Materials that are formed as a glass and then made to partly \ncrystallize by heat treatment.   Mechanically, they are very strong materials and can sustain \nrepeated thermal shocks.  They have very low heat conduction coefficients and can be made \nnearly transparent.\nBrittle Material:  Materials, such as glass and ceramics, that are characterized by the \nfact that rupture occurs without any noticeable earlier change in the rate of elongation, i.e., \nthere is no plastic deformation before fracture.  The material will not yield under load before \nbreaking.  There is no difference between the ultimate strength of the material and its breaking \nstrength. \n\nCatastrophic Hazard:  A hazard that can result in a disabling or fatal personnel injury or \n\nloss of flight hardware, ground facilities, or mission-critical equipment. \n\nCeramics:  Materials that are joined by ionic or covalent bonds and are complex\ncompounds, consisting of both metallic and non-metallic elements.  These are hard, brittle, \nhigh-melting-point materials with good chemical and thermal stability and high compressive \nstrengths.  The most important of the non-crystalline ceramic materials are glasses. \n\nCertification:  This process consists of qualification testing, any major ground testing, \n\nacceptance testing, and any other testing and the analyses required to determine that the design \nhardware from the component through the subsystem level meets the specified requirements. \n\nCritical Hazard:  A hazard that can result in a non-disabling personnel injury; damage"
